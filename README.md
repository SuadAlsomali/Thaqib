# X-ray-Baggage-Scanner-Detection

# Project Overview
#### This project aims to automate the detection of dangerous items during X-ray screenings using AI technology. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and YOLOv8 models, trained on a dataset of over 8,000 X-ray images. These models have been fine-tuned to accurately identify dangerous objects like wrenches, scissors, pliers, knives, and guns. The goal is to enhance safety and efficiency by strengthening security measures and reducing wait times and potential disruptions for passengers.


# Dataset Structure:
## Total Images: (8,295 images)
### Training set: 5,806 images
### Validation set: 1,660 images
### Testing set : 829 images

### Classes:
#### wrenches, scissors, pliers, knives, and guns.

### The repository contains the dataset and necessary codebase including the CNN, YOLOv8, and streamlit . 

# Future Work
### As technology advances, there is potential for further improvements and expansions of the project. Some possible future enhancements include:

### - Obtaining larger dataset and expanding the range of detectable prohibited items
### - Implement  X-ray Baggage Scanner Detection on edge devicee
